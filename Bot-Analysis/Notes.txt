This is it! No more additions, just adjusting of weights

3 things:
	1. I No longer want TA-api, too much money. 
	2. I want to use longer timeframes now.
	3. Give more importance to certain candles.

	Bearish:
		- downward cross of macd from above 0 to below 0
		- downward cross of macd below 9 day ema for macd
		- downward trend of macd and 9 day ema
	Additional Factors:
		- should measure the distance between the macd and 9 day ema

Analysis:
we are going to score the indicators 


Exit Strategy:
	- we want to base our exits off stop losses and capitulation on indicators





	/*
				what we want to indicate on for scalping:
					Timeframe Agnostic (works with them all):
					- 34 EMA, 50 EMA, 75 EMA, 100 EMA, 200 EMA (Exponential Movaing Average tells you about price change over X amount of days)
					- 50 period CCI (Commodity Channel Index tells you when an investment is reaching a condition of being overbought/oversold), when above 0 line then bullish and inverse is bearish
					- Stochastic RSI (Relative Strength Index tells you whether it is overbought or oversold utilizing stochastic formula)
					- Set a 7-10% (honestly might wanna tighten this even further) Stop Loss or when there is a recent swing high/low move Stop Loss into breakeven once possible to cover fees while setting a Tkae Profit (TP) at 10%
					- Market order buy in and using limit order for (TP- Take Profit) to cut fees down

					1 Minute Buy Signals:
					- Once 50 period CCi crosses above zero line, roughly 20-30 minutes later Stochastic RSI will make a pullback into oversold for your buy Signal take entry when Stochastic RSI crosses above 20 line

					1 Minute Sell Signals:
					- Once 50 period crosses below the zero line, roughly 20-30 minutes later Stochastic RSI will make a pullback into overbought for your sell signal take entry when Stochastic RSI crosses below the 80 line

					3 Minute Buy Signals:
					- Once 50 period CCi crosses above zero line, roughly 20-30 minutes later Stochastic RSI will make a pullback into oversold for your buy Signal take entry when Stochastic RSI crosses above 20 line
		aw
					3 Minute Sell Signals:
					- Once 50 period crosses below the zero line, roughly 20-30 minutes later Stochastic RSI will make a pullback into overbought for your sell signal take entry when Stochastic RSI crosses below the 80 line
